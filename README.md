# Repository of teaching material for product lines and variability
 
Available here: http://teaching.variability.io/

## Please contribute!

 *  Make the artifacts (e.g., slides) publicly available. It is highly recommended to
  push the content in the git repository for having sustainable
  resources (see directory [resources](https://github.com/FAMILIAR-project/teaching/blob/gh-pages/resources/))
  A temporary solution is to describe where resources are externally hosted (Google drive, Dropbox, etc.);
 * Add your contribution to the list of contributions, including a summary (edit [contributions.md](https://github.com/FAMILIAR-project/teaching/blob/gh-pages/_includes/contributions.md));
 * Add you to the list of contributors (edit [contributors.md](https://github.com/FAMILIAR-project/teaching/blob/gh-pages/_includes/contributors.md))

## Technical details

We're using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure/) and [Github pages](https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/) as a lightweight method to share and publish content. 
It will certainly evolve after the [SPLTea'15](http://spltea.irisa.fr) workshop. 

You simply have to edit [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) files and send a pull request
