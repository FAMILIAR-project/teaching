The paper reports authors' experience in teaching software product lines (SPL) for senior engineers in the company. 
An effective way for education in the experience is to teach SPL as a paradigm consisting of some key ideas and show how we can introduce the paradigm into the development process. 
The authors have used PLUS as a reference of such development process. Feature modeling is taught not only as a means of variability modeling but also as a means to facilitate construction of abstraction hierarchy and separation of concerns. 
Giving anti-patterns of feature modeling and countermeasures to them helps engineers discuss construction of better feature models.
