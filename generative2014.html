```Abstract: Teaching software engineering is an activity that needs toconstantly evolve to cope with new paradigms, principlesand techniques. In this paper, we report on several yearsof experience in teaching both generative techniques in amodel-driven engineering context and variability modelingrelated to software-product line engineering. Our currentpractice relies on making students progress on running projectsthat they evolve with dierent techniques along a semester.We also discuss the obtained benets and some perspec-tives.```
