## Context


As part of a course on "Software evolution and re-engineering" at
University of Montpellier in 2016 for MSc students.
Most of them are following a software engineering cursus. There is also an audience with an interest in research.
Several (external) instructors are involved to present specific topics: refactoring, metamodeling, reverse engineering, etc.
More details [here](http://www.lirmm.fr/users/utilisateurs-lirmm/marianne-huchard/enseignement/hmin306).

We put here the material related to configuration, variability, reuse, and software product line engineering.

Instructors: Jessie Carbonnel, Mathieu Acher

## Location of the material

[Montpellier 2016
   directory](https://github.com/FAMILIAR-project/teaching/tree/gh-pages/resources/Montpellier2016)

## Description of the material

A set of slides used for courses.
Lab sessions include:
 * exercices on feature modeling
 * exercices on [JHipster](https://jhipster.github.io/)
 * exercices on model transformations and metamodeling (the goal is to transform a feature model into a graphical visualisation)

Content is mainly in English, but some may be in French.
Please contact instructors if you need some translations.

## Description of the course

The course starts with a gentle introduction of software product lines (what and where they are, terminology and definition, SPLE process, etc.)
Then we focus on feature modeling:
 * syntacs and semantics
 * feature model synthesis
 * feature model management (slicing, merging, etc.)
Finally we explore scenarios for reverse engineering or modeling variability from existing artefacts.
