## Context

University of Rennes 1 in 2015 for MSc students (software engineering: M2GL and M2GLA; software management: MIAGE)

Instructors: Mathieu Acher and Jean-Marc J&eacute;z&eacute;quel

## Location of the material

[Rennes 2015 MDE
   directory](https://github.com/FAMILIAR-project/teaching/tree/gh-pages/resources/Rennes2015MDECourse)

## Description of the material

A set of slides used for courses.
Lab sessions and project instructions are also available.


## Description of the course

The course starts with a gentle introduction of model-driven
engineering.
Domain-specific languages (DSLs) are then described (defintions,
taxonomy, implementation techniques, etc.).
A focus is made on external DSLs with Xtext.
Techniques for metamodeling and model transformation with Xtend/Xtext
are presented.

As a running example we used a *configurable video generator*.
The last part of the course is entirely devoted to variability (modeling,
reverse engineering, testing, etc.).
Finally a project is proposed and consists in implementing a configurable, Web video generator
using JHipster for the Web stacks.
