### Call for contributions

 * Make the artifacts (e.g., slides) publicly available. It is highly recommended to
  push the content in the git repository for having sustainable
  resources (see directory [resources](https://github.com/FAMILIAR-project/teaching/blob/gh-pages/_includes/contributions.md))
  A temporary solution is to describe where resources are externally hosted (Google drive, Dropbox, etc.);
 * Add your contribution to the list of contributions, including a summary (edit <a href="https://github.com/FAMILIAR-project/teaching/blob/gh-pages/_includes/contributions.md">contributions.md</a>);
