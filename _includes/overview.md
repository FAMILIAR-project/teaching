### Presentation

Education has a key role to play for disseminating the constantly
growing body of Software Product Line (SPL) knowledge.
This repository aims to share and deliver teaching material related to
SPL, variability, configurable systems or generative approaches.

As part of <a href="http://spltea.irisa.fr/">SPLTea'15</a> workshop
(colocated with SPLC), participants will brainstorm about the repository, refine its design
and hopefully populate it with rich, structured content.

The ultimate goal is to provide a public, open, well-structured
repository of teaching material that students, practitioners,
consultants, or simply interested people (newcomers) can consult
online.
Researchers and educators can also find an interest in gathering
numerous resources for (re-)building their courses and curiculums.
