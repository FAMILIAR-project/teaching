## Context

University of Rennes 1 in 2015 for MSc students (research oriented)

Instructors: Mathieu Acher and Jean-Marc J&eacute;z&eacute;quel

## Location of the material

[Rennes 2015 MRI
   directory](https://github.com/FAMILIAR-project/teaching/tree/gh-pages/resources/Rennes2015MRICourse)

## Description of the material

A set of slides used for courses
No lab sessions but some instructions for quizz, homework (including
open problems) are available 


## Description of the course

The course starts with a gentle introduction of model-driven
engineering.
Domain-specific languages (DSLs) are then described (defintions,
taxonomy, implementation techniques, etc.).
A focus is made on external DSLs with Xtext.
Techniques for metamodeling and model transformation with Xtend/Xtext
are presented.
As a running example we used a configurable video generator.

The last part of the course is entirely devoted to variability (modeling,
reverse engineering, testing, etc.).
Finally a homework with Jhipster is proposed (students defend their
work while a summary is made in the last course).
